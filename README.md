# Code and data analysis

This repository contains the code for the following paper:

* S Orjuela, D Machlab, M Menigatti, G Marra, MD Robinson: DAMEfinder: A method to detect allele-specific differential methylation. [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/800383v1)

The structure of this repository is as follows:

* `data/` Metadata from samples analyzed and R objects (.RData files).
*  `real_data_analysis/` Contains R scripts ans bash scripts with to analyze raw BS-seq FASTQ files from two datasets: Monocyte datasets and CRC dataset.
* `score_evaluation/` R scripts to evaluate the ASMtuple score.
* `FDR_control/` R scripts to generate simulations and evaluate the FDR control in the DAME detection.
