# ASM Score and DAMEfinder

We present the Allele-Specific Methylation (ASM) score and the Differential Allele-specific MEthylation finder (DAMEfinder). The ASM score reflects a measure of ASM on a CpG tuple basis using methylation counts of the tuple: MM, MU, UM, and UU, where M stands for methylated and U stands for unmethylated. DAMEfinder uses the ASM score along with the bump hunting approach to detect regions that are Differetnially Allele-specifically MEthylated (DAMEs).

The directories:

* The simulated_data directory contains the simulated BS-seq data that was generated and all the analysis done on this data.
* The real_data directory contains the analysis done on a real adenoma data set.
* The paper_figures directory contains the figures used for the paper as well as all the code and data objects needed to generate each of them.
