# We do quality control using the fastqc command from the terminal. The following commands are done in BASH on each sample. 
# We use sample1 as an example: with sample1_R1.fastq and sample1_R2.fastq files.


# Run fastqc of forward (R1) and revers (R2) reads of the PE reads

$ fastqc sample1_R1.fastq
$ fastqc sample1_R2.fastq

# Trim the reads using Trimmomatic. For each read, we set a minimum base quality of 20 for the leading and trailing ends.
