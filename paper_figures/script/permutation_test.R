## Figure 5 -- plot distribution of DAMEs after doing permutation test
## Data: Simulated data sets (pure and noisy)

## Pure 

## rda file needed: 
## extra file: 
## What we do: Permute the sample labels and use DAMEfinder to predict DAMEs. We compare to the DAMEs predicted on the true sample labels 


## Load data
